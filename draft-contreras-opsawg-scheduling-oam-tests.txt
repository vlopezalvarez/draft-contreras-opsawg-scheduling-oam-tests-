1.  Introduction

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) tasks are
   fundamental functions of the network management (see, e.g.,
   [RFC7276]).  Given the emerging of data models and their utilization
   in Service Provider's network management and the need to automate the
   overall service management lifecycle [RFC8969], the management of OAM
   operations is key.  Relevant data models are still missing to cover
   specific needs.

   Specifically, OAM functions provide the means to identify and isolate
   faults, measure and report of performance (see section 4.2,
   [RFC6632].  For example, [RFC5860] defines the three main areas
   involved in OAM:

   *  Fault management, which allows network operators to quickly
      identify and isolate faults in the network.  Examples of these
      mechanisms for fault detection and isolation are: continuity
      check, link trace, and loopback.

   *  Performance management enables monitoring network performance and
      diagnosing performance issues (i.e., degradation).  Some of the
      measurements such as frame delay measurement, frame delay
      variation measurement, and frame loss measurement.

   *  Security management defines mechanisms to protect OAM
      communications from unauthorized access and tampering.

   [RFC7276] presents OAM tools for detecting and isolating failures in
   networks and for performance monitoring, some examples are:

   *  Continuity Check: This function verifies that a path exists
      between two points in a network and that the path is operational.

   *  Loopback: This function allows a device to loop back a received
      packet back to the sender for diagnostic purposes.  There are
      multiple tecnologies for this function, like IP Ping, VCCV Ping,
      LSP Ping or Ethernet Loopback.

   *  Link Trace: This function allows a network operator to trace a
      path through a network from one device to another.  Some
      technologies following this approach are Y.1731 Linktrace
      [ITU-T-Y1731] or IP traceroute.

   *  Performance Monitoring: This function allows a network operator to
      monitor the performance of a network and to identify and diagnose
      performance issues.  Protocols like TWAMP, or Y.1731 DMM/SLM
      [ITU-T-Y1731] can obtain performance measurements.

   More recently, Incident Management
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang] focuses on of incident
   diagnosis, which can be favored by dynamic invocation of OAM tests.

   [RFC8531], [RFC8532], [RFC8533] and [RFC8913] defined YANG models for
   OAM technologies: + [RFC8531] defines a YANG data model for
   connection-oriented OAM protocols.  The main aim of this document is
   to define a generic YANG data model that can be used to configure,
   control and monitor connection-oriented OAM protocols such as MPLS-TP
   OAM, PBB-TE OAM, and G.7713.1 OAM. + [RFC8532] provides a generic
   YANG data model that can be used to configure, control and monitor
   connectionless OAM protocols such as BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection), LBM (Loopback Messaging) and VCCV (Virtual Circuit
   Connectivity Verification). + [RFC8533] provides a YANG data model
   that can be used to retrieve information related to OAM protocols
   such as Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), Loopback Messaging
   (LBM) and Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV). -
   [RFC8913] specifies a YANG data model for client and server
   implementations of the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP).

   These RFCs defined the parameters required for each of the different
   tests that are used in network elements today.  This document covers
   how to use OAM for network-wide use cases.  Following, some
   illustrative examples are presented.

   The YANG data model resulting from this document will conform to the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology and Notations

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC7950], [RFC8345], [RFC8346] and [RFC8795].

   Following terms are used for the representation of this data model.

   *  OAM unitary test: A set of parameters that define a type of OAM
      test to be invoked.  As an example, it includes the type test,
      configuration parameters, and target results.

   *  OAM test sequence: A set of OAM unitary tests that are run based
      on a set of time constraints, number of repetitions, order, and
      reporting outputs.

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119], [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Network-wide OAM Use Cases

2.1.  Troubleshooting

   After the detection of a problem [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology] in the
   network, OAM tests are performed to find the root cause for the
   detected problem.  However, a detected problem can be caused by a
   variety of factors, such as a misconfiguration, hardware failure, or
   a software bug.  OAM tests can help to find the root cause by testing
   specific components of the network and looking for anomalies or
   issues.  Also, the reliability and efficiency of the tests, depends
   on the nature of the test itself.

   There are a variety of OAM tests that can be executed as a function
   of the target scenario.  For example, if the issue is related to a
   Layer 2 capability, specific tests can be designed and run to check
   the status of the path via Ethernet Linktrace and later run an
   Ethernet Loopback to a concrete network element.  These tests can be
   coupled with others to test if any filtering is in place by varying,
   e.g., some Layer 2 fields or checking the configuration of relevant
   nodes.  If these tests are correct, the operator may want to check
   the availability of the service (or its delivered performance).

   Even though the troubleshooting process may be different depending on
   the problem detected, there are certain common procedures or logics
   that can be executed in order to narrow down the cause of the problem
   and thus help isolating candidate root cause.

2.2.  Birth Certificate

   The aim of a birth certificate process is to validate that all
   relevant parameters are set appropriately in accordance with the
   target network service.  The birth certificate process is done once
   the configuration of the network elements is completed and they are
   ready for service.

   If the birth certificate is successful, it means that the network
   service is functioning correctly (that is, measured service is
   matching the expected service) and meets the requirements defined by
   the operator.  The process requires running a set of OAM tasks (e.g.,
   tests) to verify that the service is performing as expected.

   The set of OAM tests conducted as part of a birth certificate process
   depends on the network service that is tested.  For example, if the
   service is a Virtual Private Network (VPN).  Two-Way Active
   Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Light [RFC5357] will be used, while if
   the service is an E-LINE, ITU-T Y.1731 Ethernet CFM tests
   [ITU-T-Y1731] will be executed.

   Typically, once the birth certificate process has been completed and
   the OAM tests have been executed, the test results are stored as part
   of the documentation process performed by the operator.  Many of
   these tasks take place during pre-deployment phases.

2.3.  Proactive Supervision

   Some network services require to fulfill strict Service Level
   Agreements (SLAs).  An SLA defines the performance parameters that
   the service must fulfill in order to meet the requirements of the
   customer or end user (e.g., IP Connectivity Provisioning Profile
   (CPP) [RFC7297] and Network Slice Service [RFC9543]).

   As part of service fulfillment and assurance (e.g., Section 2.3.3 of
   [RFC4176]), proactive verification is undertaken to assess whether
   SLAs are met and implement appropriate adjustment measures when
   service distortion is observed.  Proactive supervision requires
   running tests both end-to-end, but also on service components to
   identify early symptoms and resolve issues before they impact the
   customer or end user, or to prevent or minimize the impact of the end
   user.  Mitigation action may be enforced to soften the impact of
   networks incidents and soften/nullify the impact on services that are
   delivered via that network.

   Proactive testing might be done via OAM tests.  These tests can be
   run periodically at regular intervals depending on the specific SLA
   requirements and the network operator procedures.  These procedures
   may require documenting the test results for future auditing
   processes with the customers (eventually, negotiated and agreed with
   a customer as part of service assurance).

2.4.  Performance-based Path Routing

   Path Computation Elements (PCEs) are used to compute end-to-end paths
   in a network [RFC4655].  PCEs are used for Traffic Engineering (TE)
   purposes (e.g., optimize network performance, reduce congestion, and
   improve the overall user experience).

   There are different algorithms to calculate a path in the network for
   some of them the PCE requires traffic engineering information.  TE
   information includes data such as link metrics, bandwidth
   availability, and routing constraints.  By using this information,
   the PCE can compute the optimal path for a particular service, taking
   into account its constraints and requirements.  OAM techniques allow
   obtaining link metrics like delay and loss which can be used in the
   PCE algorithms.

3.  Modelling the Scheduling of OAM Tests

   This document specifies two models: OAM unitary test and OAM test
   sequence models.

3.1.  OAM Unitary Test

   The OAM unitary test model encompasses parameters that define a
   specific type of OAM test to be performed.  The YANG model includes a
   container named "oam-unitary-tests" that serves as a container for
   activating OAM unitary tests for network diagnosis procedures.
   Inside the container, there is a list called "oam-unitary-test"
   representing a list of specific OAM unitary tests.  The list key is
   defined as "name", which provides a unique name for each test.  Each
   OAM test in the list references a test type with its concrete
   parameters.  The test types are out of the scope of this document.
   Moreover, each OAM unitary test has two temporal parameters: "period-
   of-time" and "recurrence".  Both are imported from the "ietf-
   schedule" module from [I-D.ietf-netmod-schedule-yang]. "period-of-
   time" identifies the period values that contain a precise period of
   time, while "recurrence" identifies the properties that contain a
   recurrence rule specification. "unitary-test-status" enumerates the
   state of the OAM unitary test.

   Figure 1 shows the structure of OAM unitary test module:

        module: ietf-oam-unitary-test
          +--rw oam-unitary-tests
             +--rw oam-unitary-test* [name]
                +--rw name                      string
                +--rw (test-type)
                +--rw period-description?       string
                +--rw period-start              yang:date-and-time
                +--rw time-zone-identifier?     sys:timezone-name
                +--rw (period-type)?
                |  +--:(explicit)
                |  |  +--rw period-end?         yang:date-and-time
                |  +--:(duration)
                |     +--rw duration?           duration
                +--rw recurrence-description?   string
                +--rw frequency                 identityref
                +--rw interval?                 uint32
                +--rw unitary-test-status?      enumeration

                Figure 1: Tree Structure of OAM Unitary Test

   The 'unitary-test-status' state machine is shown in Figure 2.  The
   state machine includes the following states:

   *  "planned": The initial state where the test is planned.

   *  "configured": The state where the test is being configured.

   *  "ready": The state where the test is ready to be executed.

   *  "on-going": The state where the test is currently running.

   *  "stop": The state where the test is manually stopped.

   *  "error": The state where an error occurs during the test.

   *  "finished": The final state where the test is completed.

3.2.  OAM Test Sequence

   The OAM test sequence model consists of a collection of OAM unitary
   tests that are executed based on specified time constraints,
   repetitions, ordering, and reporting outputs.  These sequences
   provide a structured approach to running multiple OAM tests in a
   coordinated manner.

   Each OAM test sequence references an OAM unitary test type with its
   concrete parameters.  Each OAM test sequence has two temporal
   parameters: "period-of-time" and "recurrence".  Both are imported
   from the "ietf-schedule" module from [I-D.ietf-netmod-schedule-yang].
   "period-of-time" identifies the period values that contain a precise
   period of time, while "recurrence" identifies theproperties that
   contain a recurrence rule specification. "unitary-test-status"
   enumerates the state of the OAM test.  Finally, "test-sequence-
   status" shows the state of the OAM test sequence.

   Figure 3 shows the structure of OAM test sequence module:

        module: ietf-oam-test-sequence
          +--rw oam-test-sequence
             +--rw test-sequence* [name]

                +--rw test-sequence-status?     enumeration

                        Figure 3: OAM test sequence

   The 'test-sequence-status' state machine is shown in Figure 4.  The
   state machine includes the following states:

   *  "planned": The initial state where the test is planned.

   *  "configured": The state where the test is being configured.

   *  "ready": The state where the test is ready to be executed.

   *  "on-going": The state where the test is currently running.

   *  "stop": The state where the test is manually stopped.

   *  "success": The state when all unitary tests were successful.

   *  "failure": The state when one or more tests in the sequence got an
      error.

   *  "error": The state where an error occurs during the test.

5.  Using Device Mode Within OAM Scheduling Models

   This section discusses the issues related to reusing device models
   already defined in IETF within the context of scheduling OAM tests.
   There are two main approaches to enable OAM scheduling models: *
   Importing YANG model into the OAM scheduling models.  This approach
   will copy the device model into the OAM unitary test model to enable
   the configuration and utilization of the desire OAM test.  This
   approach requires to recreate new YANG models for each new test type
   or variation of the device models.  * Schema-mount allows mounting a
   data model at a specified location of another (parent) schema.  The
   main difference with importing the YANG modules is that they don't
   have to be prepared for mounting; any existing modules such as "ietf-
   twamp" can be mounted without any modifications.

   As an exmaple, we will use [RFC8913], which defines a YANG data model
   for TWAMP, to illustrate how device models could be used.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module targeted in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   In which refers to the scheduling of the tests, security
   considerations in [I-D.ietf-netmod-schedule-yang] are also applicable
   here.

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBC

8.  Implementation Status

   This section will be used to track the status of the implementations
   of the model.  It is aimed at being removed if the document becomes
   RFC.

Appendix A.  Examples

   This section includes a non-exhaustive list of examples to illustrate
   the use of the models defined in this document.

A.1.  Create a TWAMP OAM test

   [RFC8913] defines a YANG model for TWAMP.  There is an example for
   TWAMP.  The following example contains the information for the four
   configurations (Control-Client, Server, Session-Sender and Session-
   Reflector).

   An example of a request message body to create a TWAMP OAM test is
   shown in Figure 5.  Session-Sender and Session-Reflector as expanded
   for illustrative purposes.  The TWAMP Test scheduled in this
   configuration is a one-hour performance monitoring test that runs
   daily at 9 AM UTC.  This test session is configured to start on
   October 17, 2023, at 09:00 UTC and recur at the same time every day.
   The duration of each test run is one hour, as specified by the ISO
   8601 format "PT1H", with the test status marked as "scheduled".  The
   test provides insight into network performance by monitoring the
   selected parameters, allowing for the detection of any potential
   degradations in service quality over time.
